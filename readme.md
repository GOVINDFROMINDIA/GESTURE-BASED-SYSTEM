# GESTURE BASED SYSTEM CONTROL
#### ABSTRACT
From simple nods and handshakes to complex sign languages, hand gestures are an integral part of communication. The use of hand gestures for system control can provide an intuitive and convenient user interface.

However, existing research in the field which uses haar cascade algorithms, morphological filtering, background subtraction has been limited by issues such as low accuracy, high processing time, and the ability to only perform a limited number of operations.

In this project, we propose a solution to these issues by using the Mediapipe library and computer vision techniques to enable the recognition of a wide range of hand gestures for controlling a computer system

The proposed system is capable of accurately recognizing hand gestures in real-time, allowing for seamless and intuitive control of a computer system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of experiments, showcasing its ability to accurately recognize a range of hand gestures and perform a variety of operations on a computer system. We also discuss the real-life applications of our system, including its potential use in controlling Android TVs, VR headsets, and other devices.

The proposed model addresses the limitations of the previous model by providing improved accuracy, faster processing time, and reduced computational complexity.
